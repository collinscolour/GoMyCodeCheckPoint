        "In this checkpoint, you are going to work on the '5G-Energy consumption' dataset that was provided by the international telecommunication union (ITU) in 2023 as part of a global challenge or competition for data scientists all over the world to solve the 5G energy consumption modelling using machine learning techniques.\n",

        "Checkpoint problematic : Network operational expenditure (OPEX) already accounts for around 25 percent of the total telecom operator’s cost, and 90 percent of it is spent on large energy bills. More than 70 percent of this energy is estimated to be consumed by the radio access network (RAN), particularly by the base stations (BSs). Thus, the objective is to build and train a ML model to estimate the energy consumed by different 5G base stations taking into consideration the impact of various engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.\n",
